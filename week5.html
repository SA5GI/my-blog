        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>This week, I learned a lot of valuable concepts that helped deepen my understanding of databases and design structure. We had an in-depth lesson on SQL databases—covering what queries are, how they work, and how database structures can be applied to our own projects. I was also introduced to Supabase, which offers a simplified way to manage databases. That was a particularly exciting discovery, as it seems like a powerful tool to use in real-world applications. Additionally, the lecture on ethics was insightful—it gave me a broader perspective on how ethical design affects both users and wider communities. I also enjoyed the session on creating style guides, especially the tips on color palette building and shading in Figma. Melody’s walkthrough was clear and provided useful tricks for refining brand visuals.
        </p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>Although we were encouraged to apply Supabase to our reflective blogs, I struggled to implement it and didn’t manage to get it working. I felt unsure about how to properly connect everything, so I ended up postponing it. I also didn’t make as much progress on the type brief as I’d hoped, mainly because I was still catching up on work from the previous week.</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Improved</h2>
        <p>Supabase isn’t as hard as it seems, but I’m letting my uncertainty hold me back. On top of that, my type brief still needs more development — especially the poster design, which isn’t quite resolved yet and needs further refinement. I also haven’t completed my lo-fi prototype, which is crucial to have done soon so I can begin work on the hi-fi version without falling behind. Time management is a key area I need to improve in order to stay on top of everything.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>In the next sprint, I plan to seek guidance on how to properly apply Supabase to my reflective blog so I can stop putting it off and finally implement it with confidence. I’ll also make it a priority to catch up on the tasks I missed last week, making sure I’m well-prepared for the upcoming work-in-progress checkpoint. As part of this, I’ll continue refining my style guide, applying the Figma techniques we learned—especially around shading and color palette development.
