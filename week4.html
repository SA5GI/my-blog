        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>This week was better from the start since I felt almost completely recovered from being unwell. At college, we learned how to work with databases, which at first seemed confusing, but Simon explained it in a straightforward, easy-to-understand manner. That made it clearer, and I now know how to store user data in practice (e.g., for sign-ups or email addresses). On Tuesday, Simon did a playful UX demo using p5.js, which was more interesting than I had anticipated. The “vibecoding” approach made it less daunting and more accessible. I also got most done in terms of my presentation slides, and I began working on my logo sketches and vector designs in Illustrator.
        </p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>Regrettably, I got unwell again during mid-week and wasted Wednesday's production day. On top of this, I had to contend with packing up the house and moving houses, which introduced a lot of stress and chaos into the week. This greatly disrupted my workflow. I found I was unable to get my presentation slides completed by deadline, and struggled to get any real direction for my stylescapes. On top of this, I had a sleepless night prior to Thursday and had to acquire a medical certificate in order to ask for an extension, which fortunately was granted. By Friday and Saturday, I was concentrating on moving into the new house and sorting out the new residence, leaving me drained and behind at uni.</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Improved</h2>
        <p>I need to manage my time and energy more effectively, particularly when unforeseen life circumstances do not work out. I need to develop more confident visual direction and not get discouraged by uncertain design decisions. Having more defined goals and working in small sections would enable me to remain focused, even during chaotic weeks. Alerting my lecturers earlier would also minimize stress levels and enable me to get more help.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>My intention for next sprint is to finalize my stylescapes and create a solid brand visual style. I’ll create a suitable lo-fi prototype for my website, one that I have been keeping behind schedule, and dedicate time to thinking through interaction concepts for the site. I’ll catch up on any work I’ve fallen behind on so I can begin Week 6 without undue stress. Most importantly, I’ll engage regularly with my lecturers to keep them apprised of my circumstances and progress, and create a formulated week-to-week schedule to remain focused despite outside distractions.
