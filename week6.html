        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>Although this week felt like it passed very quickly, it still included some valuable learning experiences. Simon introduced us to how Supabase can be integrated into our reflective blogs, allowing for quicker and easier editing — and while I didn’t fully understand it yet, it started to make more sense conceptually. The joint UX writing lecture was another highlight. Ashley guided us through how to write brand-friendly copy, helping us understand how tone and voice can shape user experience. The exercises were engaging and fun. I also began preparing for my work-in-progress presentation and, despite being nervous, I managed to showcase what I had. Presenting my early wireframes helped me get clarity on layout structure and introduced me to Figma’s new grid system, which I found very useful after watching some tutorials. I also made decent progress on my interactive web idea, and even though it's still buggy, I’m excited to see it starting to come together.
        </p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>I still don’t fully understand how to apply Supabase to my reflective blog and didn’t make the effort to focus properly during the lesson — it felt a bit overwhelming. I also procrastinated during parts of the week, especially when working from home on Wednesday, which slowed down my productivity. I wasn’t able to show much progress in my presentation, and my wireframes were very raw. Although I did my best, it’s clear I still have a lot to catch up on. My interactive web project, while progressing, is still full of bugs and needs serious refinement.</h2>
        <p>I need to dedicate more focused time to understanding Supabase properly instead of pushing it aside. My type brief is still underdeveloped and must be prioritised this coming week, especially the poster and interactive component. I also need to finish my hi-fi prototype, as that’s what will feed directly into the coding and development phase. Time management and focus — especially when studying from home — are areas I know I can improve on.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>In the upcoming sprint, I plan to finalise my hi-fi prototype and prepare it for the development stage. I’ll begin coding the hi-fi version of my website and aim to conduct some initial user testing to check usability and flow. A key focus will also be on completing my type brief — especially the poster and the interactive component — as there’s only one week left. To stay on track, I’ll set clearer study hours when working from home to minimise procrastination, and I’ll revisit Supabase integration with a more focused approach, reaching out for help if I continue to feel unsure about how it works.
