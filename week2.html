        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>During Week 2, I made solid progress with my idea development. My research led to some really interesting insights, especially after conducting the peer interviews on Wednesday. These conversations gave me a new perspective and helped me better understand how people interact with digital experiences. I also looked into the success of Pokémon GO and explored similar business models, which naturally guided me toward the idea of creating an augmented reality (AR) experience.

            Presenting during the work-in-progress session was another highlight. Based on the peer feedback I received, it seems the concept resonated well. Although I suspect some of the comments were a bit too generous, I still appreciated the positive energy. I tried to be as honest and constructive with my feedback for others, so I hope the same came through from them. One thing I really enjoyed was listening to everyone else’s ideas—it was genuinely inspiring to see the different directions people are taking. It gave me a better appreciation of the creative process and made me more excited about shaping my own project.</p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge this week was definitely the clarity of my idea. Even though I’ve made progress, I still feel unsure about what the final product will look like or how the experience will function as a whole. There’s a bit of a fog between concept and execution, which is making me doubt its potential. Part of this comes from the fact that I rushed through certain parts of the week, mostly due to procrastination and struggling with focus. I noticed I was being quite lazy, especially when working from home—it's way too easy to get distracted. My phone is probably the main culprit, and while I keep telling myself to just put it away, it somehow always finds its way back into my hand.</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Improved</h2>
        <p>I need to bring more clarity to my final idea. Right now, it’s a bit loose and needs a stronger structure in terms of user flow, experience goals, and problem-solving elements. Finalizing the user persona’s future journey is also a priority—I want to ensure their experience feels realistic and aligned with the purpose of the product. Additionally, I need to dive deeper into the business analysis. Understanding how the idea could work in a commercial context will be key moving forward, especially since monetization and user retention are important aspects of AR-based platforms.

            Another thing I need to improve is my time management. Week 2 reminded me that I tend to cram or rush through tasks when I leave them too late. Building a more consistent daily routine—even just blocking time for deep work—will help me stay on track.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>For the next sprint, I’ll focus on polishing my idea into a more refined concept, with a clearly defined user problem and a structured AR experience that addresses it. I plan to complete the user persona journey map and tie that directly into how the app or product will support them across different touchpoints. I’ll also deepen my business analysis, focusing on value proposition, target audience, and how the idea can scale or generate revenue.

            Additionally, I’m going to make time to improve my JavaScript skills. It’s becoming a major part of our toolkit, and I want to feel more confident when we start integrating more interactive components. To help with that, I’ll set aside time each week for practice and maybe explore a few beginner tutorials or mini-projects to reinforce what we’re learning in class.
            
            Lastly, I’ll try to be stricter with managing distractions—maybe try using a focus app or setting up a proper study/work space so that I can actually stay in the zone.</p>
