        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>In week one, the sprint goal was to learn how to use a GitHub repository and successfully launch a basic blog
            using Netlify. We were also asked to revisit our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating a cupcake
            website. Another key task was to generate three problem statements and narrow them down to one. Finally, we
            needed to create and publish a blog post on our live Netlify site.

            Overall, I felt quite positive about how the week went. I was able to conduct research into potential
            problem areas, which helped me understand whether the issues I was considering were realistic and achievable
            within the 8-week timeframe. ChatGPT played a major role in this process — I used its deep research feature
            to explore a wide range of sources, which gave me helpful insights in just a few minutes.

            Setting up Git and launching the website on Netlify was surprisingly smooth. I figured everything out
            quickly and was satisfied with the outcome, as I didn’t run into any major issues. Creating the problem
            statements was also relatively easy. There are so many real-world issues to tackle, but it takes creative
            thinking to approach them in a way that hasn’t already been done.

            Building the weekly blog felt simple at this early stage since it's still very basic. Now that I’m writing
            this reflection, I feel more grounded in the sprint process and understand what I’ve done and what still
            needs attention.</p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>One area that didn’t go well was my attempt to recap HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I don’t feel confident in my
            coding skills yet, and it’s something I find frustrating. Still, I’ve been trying to stick with it by
            reminding myself that sometimes you need to embrace what you dislike in order to grow — and that mindset has
            helped a bit.

            Staying focused has also been a challenge. I find myself easily distracted and able to spend hours doing
            something like gardening, but struggling to sit down and work on university tasks. While I did come up with
            problem statements, I’m still unsure about which one to pursue. I feel overwhelmed by the amount of
            information I consume through media like Reddit and YouTube, which clutters my thoughts. However, I’ve found
            that meditating before lectures really helps clear my mind and improve my focus — so I’ll continue doing
            that.</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Improved</h2>
        <p>I need to finalize my problem statement and make sure it connects to the idea of reducing information
            overload and helping the mind shift away from constant digital input. My schedule also needs to be more
            consistent. Right now, I’m too flexible with my sleep and daily routine, and it’s affecting my productivity.

            Most importantly, I need to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript and CSS. I often feel lost in class
            and behind on the techniques we’re learning, which sometimes makes me want to give up. But I’ve learned that
            pushing through discomfort is part of the journey, and I’m working on building more discipline and reducing
            procrastination.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>For the next sprint, I will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare for my work-in-progress presentation</li>
            <br>
            <li>Conduct an interview with one of my classmates to gain more insight into my chosen problem</li>
            <br>
            <li>Begin developing a creative solution</li>
            <br>
            <li>Create user personas and an empathy map</li>
            <br>
            <li>Dedicate focused time to learning and practicing JavaScript and CSS</li>
            <br>
            <li>Analyse similar solution to my idea</li>
