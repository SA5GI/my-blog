        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
        <p>This week started off on a high note. We got introduced to GSAP, which honestly blew my mind a bit. I didn’t
            even know this kind of animation tool existed, and now that I do, I’m hooked. I watched a few tutorials,
            experimented with it here and there, and I loved how intuitive and powerful it felt—especially compared to
            stuff like p5.js which always felt more code-heavy. GSAP feels like a major upgrade for interactive design,
            and I’m genuinely excited to keep learning and using it in my web projects.

            Tuesday was another highlight—we explored scroll triggers in GSAP, and that just opened even more
            possibilities. I really had fun playing around with it, and it gave me ideas for how I can bring more life
            and movement into my designs.

            Friday was also super productive. We worked on our Kiwi Culture posters, and Simon’s feedback was really
            helpful. He gave me a clear direction, and now I feel more confident about how to move forward with it. I
            also finally nailed down my idea for the project, and I’m feeling good about it—can’t wait to present it!
        </p>
        <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
        <p>Mid-week was rough. I got really sick on Wednesday and Thursday, and it totally knocked me out. I missed the
            joint lecture and didn’t show up on campus either. I still managed to catch parts of the lecture online, but
            I wasn’t in the best state to absorb everything properly. It was frustrating because I wanted to stay on
            track, but I just didn’t have the energy to do much besides rest.

            Because of that, I fell a bit behind on my lo-fi prototype and haven’t made much progress on my Kiwi Culture
            poster. I was mostly just taking in information passively instead of actively creating. Also, even though I
            found the design strategy lecture interesting, I didn’t pay as much attention to it as I should have.</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Improved</h2>
        <p>I think the main thing I need to work on is time and energy management—especially when I’m not feeling well.
            I tend to push myself or feel guilty when I can’t do much, but I need to plan better for recovery time and
            create smaller achievable goals on those tough days. I also want to be more hands-on during the lectures
            instead of just listening in. I learn better by doing, and I think it’ll help me stay engaged even when I’m
            tired or sick.</p>
        <h2>What Actions Will I Take for the Next Sprint</h2>
        <p>For my next sprint, I’m planning to catch up on the work I fell behind on, starting with finishing my lo-fi
            prototype so I can get proper feedback and move into the next phase. I also need to focus on completing and
            refining my Kiwi Culture poster, putting in more time and creative energy to really bring it to life. I’ll
            begin compiling my design strategy document and start putting together my presentation so I’m not rushing it
            at the last minute. A big goal for me is to explore GSAP more deeply—I want to practice building animations
            and experiment with scroll-triggered effects to become more confident using it in future projects. Lastly,
            I’ll improve how I manage my time and energy by breaking my tasks into smaller goals, reviewing my lecture
            notes regularly, and setting aside dedicated time each day to stay on track and avoid falling behind again.
